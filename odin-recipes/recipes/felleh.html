        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A recipe for cooking fish with a flaky, juicy, and buttery texture can
          be found in several sources. <br />
          One such method involves pan-roasting fish fillets with herb butter,
          which results in a tender fish with a toothsome crust, anointed with
          nutty, lemony brown butter. <br />
          Another approach is to bake the fish with Mediterranean flavors, using
          ingredients like oregano, garlic, tomatoes, olives, and red onions.

      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>Fish fillets: 2 (5- to 6-ounce) (about 140 to 170g)</li>
          <li>Salt and ground black pepper: To taste</li>
          <li>Grapeseed or canola oil: 3 tablespoons (45ml)</li>
          <li>Unsalted butter: 2 tablespoons (30g)</li>
          <li>Fresh thyme, tarragon, chives or another herb: 2 sprigs</li>
          <li>Chopped flat-leaf parsley: 1 tablespoon (15g), optional</li>
          <li>Lemon wedges: For serving</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Pat fillets dry with a paper towel. Season on both sides with salt
            and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a heavy 10-inch nonstick or cast-iron skillet over high heat.
            When the pan is hot, add the oil. Place the fillets in the pan, skin
            side down (if applicable), laying them down away from your body. If
            fillets have skin, press down gently with a spatula for about 20
            seconds to prevent curling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower heat to medium and let sizzle until fish is golden and
            caramelized around edges, about 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip
            fillets and add butter and thyme to pan. Tilt pan slightly to let
            the melted butter pool at one end. Use a spoon to baste the fish
            with the pooled butter. Continue basting until golden all over and
            cooked through, 45 to 90 seconds more, depending on the thickness of
            your fish. Serve immediately with chopped parsley (if using) and
            lemon wedges.
